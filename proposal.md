# X-Team 100 Project Proposal

See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description

A problem that our team would like to solve would be organizing our day and time management.  Something to keep track of events and assignments that are upcoming would be nice to have.  Paper can work but it can be easy to lose that so having a back up of that would be helpful.

Our program would allow the user to select each day of the year and input different events, assignments, or other plans and what times they are occuring.  The program would have the ability to sort by month, week, and day.  The program would also have the ability to output the schedule to a file so that it can be printed out.

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Student Calendar



2. Output: Program will display dates and times of entered events. 

           Example: 
           
           October 29 2018: 
           
           8:50 AM - CS400 Lecture (5208 Sewell Social Sciences)
           
           10:00 AM - Breakfast with Sam (1511 Monroe St)
           
           1:20 PM - MATH222 Lecture (105 Brogden Psychology Building)
           
           3:30 PM - Table Tennis Club (Natatorium)

3. Input: User will enter events with locations and times. User can enter commands to view their schedule on certain days, weeks, etc. 
  There will be a list of commands available to select.

          Example:
          
          Pick a command: *schedule*
          
          Enter event name: *user enters event*
          
          Enter event day: *user enters event date*
          
          Enter event time: *user enters time of event*
          
          Enter event location: *user enters event location*

4. User Interface: We will use a text menu to maneuver around the program.

          Example:
          
          Welcome to the Student Calendar.
          
          Enter a command.
          
          T - Show today's schedule.
          
          W - Show this week's schedule.
          
          M - Show this month's schedule.
          
          S - Schedule an event.
          
          R - Remove an event.
          
          F - Export schedule to a file.
          
          Q - Quit.


5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.



Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
