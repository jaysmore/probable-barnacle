# X-Team 100 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will read over the task and divide up work equally. If one person has a disproportionately low/high workload we will have team members with lower workloads help those with higher workloads. Tasks will be assigned via group chat if not in person.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will create a chart/spreadsheet showing the different parts of the program and who is assigned to each task. This chart will display the status of the tasks/sub-tasks. This document will be available to all group members to edit.  After completion of a task we will notify other group members of our progress and update the tracking document accordingly.
