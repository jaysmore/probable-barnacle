# X-Team 100 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will read over the task and divide up work equally. If one person has a disproportionately low/high workload we will have team members with lower workloads help those with higher workloads. Tasks will be assigned via group chat if not in person.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will create a chart/spreadsheet showing the different parts of the program and who is assigned to each task. This chart will display the status of the tasks/sub-tasks. This document will be available to all group members to edit.  After completion of a task we will notify other group members of our progress and update the tracking document accordingly.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
If we are having problems with a task assigned to us, we will communicate this to the other group members either via group chat or in person.  We will then take the steps to try and find a solution to the problem with the task and balance out accordingly.  If no team member is able to solve the issue, we will set up a meeting with a CS tutor to attempt to resolve either the problem or a similar problem so that we can understand what we need to do.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
In order to ensure that we meet the deadlines we will check in with the other team members regarding progress at different time intervals depending on the amount of time to do the project.  If someone is falling behind, we will distribute the work accordingly so that the project can be completed on time.  We will consult the progress tracking document accordingly to determine what work is left to do and make sure that work is not overlapping on the deadlines required.
